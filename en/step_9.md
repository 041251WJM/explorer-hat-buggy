## What next?

- Can you add more buttons to your GUI - make the robot go backwards, or turn left and right?

- Could you add pictures (e.g. arrows) to the buttons to show what they do, instead of words? Use the [documentation](https://lawsie.github.io/guizero/pushbutton/){:target="_blank"} to help you.

- Could you lay out the buttons in a better way? There is the option for a [grid layout in guizero](https://lawsie.github.io/guizero/box/){:target="_blank"} that you could use.
